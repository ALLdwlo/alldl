Other languages may be missing some strings or changes, you can help with updating those!

## How you can help cobalt speak your language
Take English or Russian localization from [this directory](https://github.com/wukko/cobalt/tree/current/src/localization/languages) and use it as a base for your translation. Then simply make a pull request and it'll be out for everyone upon review!

### What you should keep in mind:
- Do **NOT** use formal language, that's boring and lame. Use informal language on all occasions.
- Strings are **ALWAYS** lowercase unless it's an internal value like {ContactLink} or STRESSED LIKE THIS.
- Keep translations as friendly and fun as possible. Just as if cobalt user was your buddy.
- Robotic translations from original language are not valid.
- You can (and should) rephrase sentences as long as they keep the same sense, if you think it'd be better that way.
- You can add wordplays or puns if it feels natural to do so.
- Even though I love cursing, keep that to minimum in translations, and do **NOT** use offensive words.
- Always check if there are issues in UI with your localization.
- There's no need to translate `ChangelogContentTitle` and `ChangelogContent`, because those are very often changed. You can remove both of them from your translation file.
- Add "(in english)" translated to your language at the end of `ChangelogLastCommit` and `ChangelogLastMajor`. Those are almost always kept exclusively in English. Remove that phrase if you do translate major update changelog.
    - Example: `"ChangelogLastCommit": "последний коммит (на английском)"`
- Be nice.
